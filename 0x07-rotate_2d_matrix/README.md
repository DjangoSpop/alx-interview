Matrix Representation in Python:

In Python, a 2D matrix can be represented using a list of lists. Each inner list represents a row of the matrix, and the elements within each inner list represent the values in the corresponding columns.
To access an element in a 2D matrix, you can use the syntax matrix[i][j], where i represents the row index and j represents the column index. You can modify elements using the same syntax.


In-place Operations:

In-place operations refer to modifying data structures directly without creating a new copy. This is important when you want to minimize the space complexity of your algorithm.
In the case of rotating a matrix, we can modify the matrix in-place by swapping elements within the matrix itself, without using any extra space.


Matrix Transposition:

Transposing a matrix means swapping its rows and columns. In other words, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix becomes the element at position (j, i) in the transposed matrix.
To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can first transpose the matrix and then reverse each row.


Reversing Rows in a Matrix:

Reversing the order of elements in each row of a matrix is a common operation when performing matrix rotations.
To reverse a row, you can use the reverse() method or swap elements from both ends of the row until you reach the middle.


Nested Loops:

When working with 2D matrices, nested loops are often used to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix.
The outer loop typically represents the rows, while the inner loop represents the columns. By using nested loops, you can access and modify elements at specific positions within the matrix.
